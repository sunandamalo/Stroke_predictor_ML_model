# Predicting Stroke Rate of People based on Age and Occupation
### Project Description
#### Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the stroke rate of individuals based on their age and occupation. Stroke is a critical medical condition that occurs due to the interruption of blood supply to the brain, leading to the sudden death of brain cells. Identifying individuals at risk of stroke can significantly contribute to early prevention and timely medical interventions. This predictive model will provide valuable insights into stroke risk factors for different age groups and occupations, aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about individuals' age, occupation, and stroke occurrence. It is a curated dataset that has been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure data quality. The data has undergone extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), including visualizations of important plots and graphs, allowing us to gain valuable insights into the data distribution and relationships between independent variables.

### Approach
The project follows a systematic approach to build an accurate and robust stroke prediction model:

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering. One-hot encoding and label encoding techniques are applied to handle categorical variables. Additionally, the age values of patients are categorized for better representation in the model.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The EDA phase involves visualizing data using various plots and graphs. We analyze the distribution of variables, correlations, and patterns to understand the data better and derive meaningful insights. EDA helps us in feature selection and feature importance determination.

3. Feature Selection: Using the knowledge gained from EDA, we select the most relevant features that have a significant impact on predicting stroke rate. This process reduces the dimensionality of the dataset and improves the efficiency of the model.

4. Model Selection: Several popular classification algorithms are utilized to build predictive models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. Each model is trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics to identify the best-performing algorithm for our specific problem.

5. Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess their ability to predict stroke occurrence accurately.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning is performed using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize the model's performance. This step ensures that the models are fine-tuned for maximum accuracy.

### Python Libraries and Technologies Used

Throughout the project, we demonstrate proficiency in utilizing essential Python libraries and technologies:

1. Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
2. NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization and generating informative plots.
4. Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
5. Jupyter Notebook: For an interactive and organized development environment.
6. GitHub: For version control and collaboration on the project.
